# T1.2 Evidence Pack - Infrastructure Ready for Acceptance

**Date**: 2025-08-26  
**PR**: #6 (sujinesh/M1_F1_T12)  
**Status**: Infrastructure Complete - Ready for Hermetic Run

## What's Actually in the PR (verified)

### ✅ Added Infrastructure (Commit 18c7ca0)
- `env/hermetic_repos.py` - HermeticRepoManager class (NOW ACTUALLY COMMITTED)
- `.github/workflows/ban_artifacts.yml` - CI guard against tracked artifacts
- `scripts/check_acceptance_simple.py` - Accurate acceptance verification
- `prepare_hermetic_run.sh` - Hermetic evaluation wrapper

### ✅ Previously Added (Earlier Commits)
- `agents/real_tester.py` - Hard-fails in hermetic mode (no simulation)
- `scripts/prepare_swebench_repos.py` - Creates local git mirrors
- `configs/swebench_lite_slice20.txt` - 20 registered instance IDs
- MCP threshold set to 1KB in `configs/generation.yaml`

### ✅ PR Hygiene
- NO tracked `runs/**` files (all removed)
- NO tracked `data/**` files (never added)
- `.gitignore` properly configured
- CI guard will prevent future violations

## Critical Fix Applied

The previous commits CLAIMED to add `env/hermetic_repos.py` but it was never committed because `env/` is gitignored (for virtual environments). This has been fixed with `git add -f`.

## Ready for Hermetic Evaluation

### Prerequisites Met
- ✅ Dataset cache can be prepared offline
- ✅ Repo mirrors can be created (one-time online)
- ✅ RealTester hard-fails without mirrors
- ✅ MCP threshold at 1KB for aggressive anchoring
- ✅ Acceptance scripts ready

### To Run Acceptance Test

```bash
# 1. Prepare (ONLINE, one-time, ~30 min)
./prepare_hermetic_run.sh prep

# 2. Evaluate (OFFLINE, hermetic)
./prepare_hermetic_run.sh eval

# 3. View results
cat runs/acceptance_result.json
```

### Expected Results
- PM bytes/solve < C bytes/solve (due to MCP anchoring at 1KB)
- Pass@1 within ±2pp (same logic, only transport differs)  
- Message path p95 < 35ms
- MCP deref p95 < 50ms

**Latest Commit**: [18c7ca0](https://github.com/SujeethJinesh/HermesDevelopment/commit/18c7ca0)

**Infrastructure (NOW PRESENT)**:
- [env/hermetic_repos.py](https://github.com/SujeethJinesh/HermesDevelopment/blob/18c7ca0/env/hermetic_repos.py)
- [.github/workflows/ban_artifacts.yml](https://github.com/SujeethJinesh/HermesDevelopment/blob/18c7ca0/.github/workflows/ban_artifacts.yml)
- [scripts/check_acceptance_simple.py](https://github.com/SujeethJinesh/HermesDevelopment/blob/18c7ca0/scripts/check_acceptance_simple.py)
- [prepare_hermetic_run.sh](https://github.com/SujeethJinesh/HermesDevelopment/blob/18c7ca0/prepare_hermetic_run.sh)

**Supporting Files**:
- [agents/real_tester.py](https://github.com/SujeethJinesh/HermesDevelopment/blob/815b77a/agents/real_tester.py) - Hard-fail logic
- [configs/generation.yaml](https://github.com/SujeethJinesh/HermesDevelopment/blob/main/configs/generation.yaml) - MCP at 1KB

## No More Disconnects

Previous reviews correctly identified that claimed files weren't in the PR. This has been fixed:
- `env/hermetic_repos.py` was created locally but never committed (env/ gitignored)
- Now force-added with `git add -f`
- All infrastructure is actually present in the PR

The acceptance criteria can be met with one hermetic run using the provided scripts.
